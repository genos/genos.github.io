# All shutdown and no work makes Graham a dull boy
I've been reading [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) recently in my quest
to extend my Computer Science knowledge.
This is a task I've attempted before but never really had the time to devote a
solid chunk of brain-power to.
However, due to [recent
events](http://www.theonion.com/articles/what-a-government-shutdown-means-for-you,34052/), I find myself with more time on my hands than usual.[^1]

# SICP to the rescue
This post will be short, but I imagine I'll write another sometime soon as I
work through this amazing book.
Of course I'm not the [only](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html)
[one](http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8)
[who](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1273406) thinks so, but SICP is a
good book.
I mean, it's a *really* good book.
Within the first chapter, you've already used the Fibonacci numbers,
primality testing, Newton's Method, fixed-points and average damping, and
continued fractions to explore the benefits of having functions as [first class
citizens](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html).
This book is amazing.
I suppose that part of what makes it so good is its use of
[Scheme](http://schemers.org/) as its programming language; this leads to a
minimal barrier between expressing the ideas and executing them.
Even with that said, I'm still in awe of how good this book is.

# Case In Point
As a case in point, I'll include a [quick write
up](/public/continued_fraction.pdf) I did to share with my Dad and
his high school students.[^2]
It was inspired by SICP's handling of an interesting continued fraction.

[^1]: It's not all SICP all the time for me; I have to tackle a truly impressive list of chores as well.
[^2]: I really need to get back to work.
