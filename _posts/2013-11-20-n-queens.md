# Coding for Interviews
In order to up my programming chops, I've signed up for
[this newsletter](http://codingforinterviews.com/). It's been fun,
though I don't typically have the time/energy to answer the questions.
Somewhat serendipitously, though, they sent out a question that I've
poked my nose into recently: the
[N Queens Puzzle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).

# My Solution
I've taken the approach this newsletter seems to prefer: writing my
thinking and solution out by hand. See my write up
[here](http://imgur.com/a/piSjE).

# Critiquing Your Work
As I note in my write up, this isn't the best solution possible. In
fact, my approach is asymptotically just as bad as the naive approach,
basically, by
[Stirling's Approximation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling's_approximation).
I was going for shorter code that relied more on the Python standard
library, though.
