# A wild _e_ appears

Here's a [fun math tidbit](https://mostlymaths.net/2010/08/and-e-appears-from-nowhere.html/):

> Select a random number between 0 and 1. Now select another and add it to the
> first. Keep doing this, piling on random numbers. How many random numbers, on
> average, do you need to make the total greater than 1? Answer: 2.71828â€¦.

The inimitable [MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/UniformSumDistribution.html) has more
info on it, and the first link above has a nice proof sketch involving the
standard simplex (modified from Derbyshire's book), as well as some Clojure code.

# Repo, Man

I've used this problem for a short programming exercise a number of times, and
I really like it.
Besides the fun math involved, it can give a decent understanding of how to get
things done in a language.
For instance, tackling it in Haskell can lead to thinking about monads (or
not), while doing it in a high performance language can make one think about
ways to squeeze out every last drop of performance.
I've collected implementations in a number of different languages
[here](https://github.com/genos/rge1).
Some highlights and/or interesting points:

- The Rust version uses `rayon` for parallelism and a
  [modification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Parallel_algorithm)
  of Welford's online algorithm for calculating the mean. This problem has a
  lot of room for exploring parallelism, trading memory for time, and more.
- The array language versions in BQN and ngn/k do an approximation where
  they build a large matrix of uniform variates and approximate from there,
  rather than relying on loops or recursion.
- Writing WebAssembly by hand and calling it from TypeScript is surprisingly
  painless (thanks to a [`pcg` implementation](https://github.com/alisey/pcg32)
  I found); What's more, it's competitive with the more "low-level" C/C++ and their ilk.
- Some things are much easier to package in a `nix` flake than others.
