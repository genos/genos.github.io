# New paper, who dis?

I'm excited to announce that our paper on using classification performance on
imbalanced datasets as a proxy for measuring generative model quality [up on
the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10847)!
It combines a lot of interesting techniques, like post-hoc testing, the
Bayesian boostrap, and explainable AI techniques, all to get an idea of how
well a quantum generative model performs.
Please check it out!
