Dear Statistics,

I apologize for not having taken you seriously until this year.
I said that you aren't Mathematics; that's true, but not in the (derisive) way
I meant it.
You aren't Math in the same way that Physics isn't Math---you sure use a whole
lot of Math to do some very interesting and important things.
Really, you are the science of data;[^1] you enable us to learn and make
decisions in a noisy, uncertain world.

I changed my mind when my eyes were opened to all the useful things you can do,
of which there is a
[whole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fields_of_application_of_statistics)
[enormous,](http://www.slideshare.net/Nicolas_Nicolov/machine-learning-14528792)
[gigantic,](http://www.networkworld.com/news/tech/2013/082313-whitelisting-machine-learning-273154.html)
[humongous,](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-bayes-rules)
[impressive](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/06/norvig-vs-chomsky-and-the-fight-for-the-future-of-ai)
list.[^2]
In my ignorance and arrogance, I had no idea.
Fortunately, I had the honor of taking classes with some
[incredible](http://inside.uncc.edu/news/item/molchanov-named-ams-fellow)
professors in graduate school that opened my eyes to what your buddy
Probability had in store; once I stopped hating on Probability, it was only a
matter of time until I gave you a second look.

By and large, though, one of the biggest things that helped me appreciate you
better is my developing programming abilities.
Rather than working by hand, I can now use things like
[R](http://www.r-project.org/) to, say, flip a billion unbiased virtual coins
in the blink of an eye.
Let's be honest, you involve a lot of computation; what better tool could I use
than a computer?

That last thought reminds me: arguably one of the reasons I never took you
seriously is the poor way in which you're taught in schools.
I think you are subject to the problems mentioned in [Lockhart's
Lament](http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) even
more than Math is.
A lot of teachers seem to think you consist solely of blinding applying
formulas without understanding; as a Mathematician who loves learning and
understanding things, I too lament this deplorable idea.
As [Richard Hamming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) once said,
the purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.
I now know it makes sense to use squared distance from the mean for variance
instead of absolute distance, because doing calculus with absolute value is a
pain.
I now know that your best friend Probability is actually
[Analysis](http://www.kolmogorov.com/Foundations.html) in disguise.
Of course, there isn't a need to know graduate level Analysis to successfully
apply you, but I sure feel better knowing why I'm doing what I'm doing.
There has to be a happy medium somewhere closer to developing understanding
than what passes for Math & Stats education in most[^3] schools nowadays.

To sum up, Statistics: I apologize. Let's be friends.

Best,

Graham

[^1]: I'm avoiding calling you "Data Science," since that's too trendy, but you really are.
[^2]: I claim that if Machine Learning isn't a proper sub-discipline of Statistics, it at least uses so much statistical knowledge that it might as well be counted as a win.
[^3]: Most American schools, perhaps? My perspective is limited to my own country.
