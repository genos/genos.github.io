# Hola
Is it poor form to start each post with an apology for the time elapsed since
the previous one?
Either way, hello dear reader.
Beyond being the father of a rambunctious young'un, things have changed around
here since we last spoke.

# New Job, Plus Why Tech Companies Should Hire in DC
In January I started a new gig as a Data Scientist for
[Quantifind](http://quantifind.com/).
I'm excited about the opportunity, and the balance of faster-paced demands and
more blue-sky research has been great.

This new job has highlighted something for me: if you're a tech/data/whatever
company, you should hire people from the D.C. area.
There are a large number of people here who have the technical chops to do data
and software work, and who&mdash;given
[agency](http://www.executivegov.com/2015/12/adm-michael-rogers-nsa-to-undergo-reorganization-in-january/)
[reorganizations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-agency-plans-major-reorganization/2016/02/02/2a66555e-c960-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html)
and general [low
morale](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/07/15/new-report-documents-falling-federal-employee-morale/)&mdash;are
probably open to new opportunities.
While some may be able to pick up and move to Silicon Valley, I'd wager that
many are (like myself) unable to uproot their lives and families.
I'm fortunate that Quantifind hired me to work in the D.C. office, even though
they're based in California.
Other companies should consider tapping the large pool of talent we have in the
region.

# Revisiting Finite Fields
Now a short technical note.
In a [previous post]({% post_url 2014-09-09-finite-fields %}), I talked about
my difficulties in working with finite fields in software.
I'm starting to think that for parameterized mathematical objects (e.g. by a
prime of a prime and a polynomial, like finite fields) might be good candidates
for a [dependently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type)
[typed](http://ejenk.com/blog/why-dependently-typed-programming-will-one-day-rock-your-world.html)
language like [`Idris`](http://www.idris-lang.org/).
I don't have any experience with `Idris` myself, but I'd be curious to see a
finite field implementation in it.
