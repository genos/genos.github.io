# Introduction

In an effort to both post more than once a year and clean out some silly things
from my `~/tmp` directory, here's a quick post about two programming
shenanigans.
Perhaps unsurprisingly due to its history of jocularity, both originate with
Perl.

# Bleach

[Damian Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Conway) is a truly prolific
member of the Perl community.
One of Conway's less serious contributions is the
[`Acme::Bleach`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Acme::Bleach) module, famous for
being the [first `Acme` module and the first source filter joke
module.](https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=967004)
`Acme::Bleach` takes programs that look like this:

```perl
use Acme::Bleach;
print "Hello world";
```

and turns them into

```perl
use Acme::Bleach;
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 			   	   
 		 		 	 
 	 		  		
	 		 	 	 
 		      
	  	   		
       	 
 			 			 
 			 	   
   			   
		 		  	 
	        
			  	  	
		 	  	 	
	  			 		
   	 			 
     	   
	   	    
 	  	 	 	
  		   		
 		   		 
		 				 	
	      	 
 			 			 
				 		  
	  			   
		 		   	
  		  	  
 	  		 		
	   	 	  
  
```

No, that's not an error.
Through the magic of Perl's [source
filters](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlfilter.html), the above program whose
source consists of nothing but one import statement and a bunch of whitespace
_still prints "Hello world"!_

After digging through the source, I decided to try my hand at recreating it in
Python:

```Python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""For really clean programs"""

from functools import reduce
from pathlib import Path
from subprocess import run
from sys import argv

ZERO = ord(" ")
ONE = ord("\t")

def zero_one(x: int) -> bytes:
    """Convert a byte to a series of `ZERO` and `ONE`"""
    return bytes([ZERO, ONE][(x >> i) & 1] for i in range(7, -1, -1))

def un_zero_one(xs: bytes) -> int:
    """Undo `zero_one`"""
    return reduce(lambda i, x: (i << 1) | int(x == ONE), xs, 0)

def encode(xs: bytes) -> bytes:
    """Use `zero_one` to encode"""
    return b"".join(zero_one(x) for x in xs)

def decode(xs: bytes) -> bytes:
    """Use `un_zero_one` to decode"""
    return bytes(un_zero_one(xs[i : i + 8]) for i in range(0, len(xs), 8))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(argv) != 2:
        exit("I need a file to bleach")
    else:
        XS = Path(argv[1]).read_bytes()
        if any(x not in {ZERO, ONE} for x in XS):
            print(encode(XS).decode("ascii"), end="", flush=True)
        else:
            run(["python3", "-"], input=decode(XS))
```

Since Python doesn't have Perl's source filters, we can't do everything that
`Acme::Bleach` does, but `bleach.py` uses the same main trick: source code
consists of bytes, as far as computers care, so we can encode and decode them
however we wantâ€”including using spaces for zeros and tabs for ones.
If we have a file called `simple.py` consisting of `print("hello world")`,
we can say `./bleach.py simple.py > simple_bleached.py`.
Then running `./bleach.py simple_bleached.py` will result in the interpreter
printing `"hello world"`.

# D&D

I recently came across a [fun
post](https://aearnus.github.io/2019/08/07/d-d-rolls-in-perl-6) that describes
implementing basic dice notation from Dungeons & Dragons in Perl 6.
It's a fun read, so you should definitely check it out, but its basic
implementation looks like this:

```perl
sub infix:<d>(Int $n, Int $max) { (1..$max).pick xx $n }
```

So one can enter `say (3 d 20);` and see something like `(17 1 12)` printed.
Haskell has nice support for infix-ing any function by wrapping it in
backticks, so I came up with the following `dnd.hs`:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --install-ghc runghc --package random --resolver lts-14.0
module Main where

import Data.Foldable (traverse_)
import System.Random (getStdGen, randomRs)

d :: Word -> Word -> IO [Word]
d n size = take (fromIntegral n) . randomRs (1, size) <$> getStdGen

main :: IO ()
main = traverse_ (print =<<) [3 `d` 8, 2 `d` 20, 1 `d` 6]
```

Running it via `./dnd.hs`[^1], I got

```
[6,6,3]
[10,10]
[2]
```

Though of course different runs will probably output different results.

[^1]: Assuming of course that you've got [`stack`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(Haskell)) installed.
