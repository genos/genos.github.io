# A wretched hive of scum and villainy 

With it being my birthday today, I took a little bit of time to noodle on a pet project.
For all the computer science classes I've taken, books I've read, course notes I've looked through, and code I've written, reviewed, or perused, I had yet to implement any sort of Lisp-like language myself.
Having decided to change that, I've been toying around for the last month or so on [`scum`](https://github.com/genos/scum), a Scheme-ish, Lisp-like language implementation.
It's by no means good[^1] in any sense of the word; it's incomplete, under-commented, probably loaded with bugs, undoubtedly slow, and profligate with its memory usage.
However, as of today, it's cleared the bar I set for myself for being a reasonable-ish implementation: I can define and call [lambdas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) from the REPL!

# How long is a piece of string

There's not a lot of code currently, so feel free to peruse the [repo](https://github.com/genos/scum) yourself:

By no means as succinct as, say [`tinylisp`](https://github.com/Robert-van-Engelen/tinylisp), nor as complete as the [`mal` implementations](https://github.com/kanaka/mal), `scum` consists of

- a Rust library which defines the basic expression type, as well as a single step of the read-eval-print loop, and
- a Rust executable which does little more than reach out to [`rustyline`](https://docs.rs/rustyline/latest/rustyline/) to provide an interactive REPL:


```scheme
Î»>  (define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))
(lambda (x) (* x x))
Î»>  (square 39)
1521
```

I originally started in Haskell, but decided to shift to Rust because I kind of wanted this to be an exercise in satisfying an annoying pedant; Haskell provides so much already, it almost felt like cheating to use it.
Besides the aforementioned `rustyline` crate in `scum-repl`, I've used [`pest` and `pest_derive`](https://pest.rs/) for parsing and [`thiserror`](https://docs.rs/crate/thiserror/latest) for organizing the sundry reasons things can go wrong.
While `pest` was new to me and has been fun, I've used `thiserror` on other projects at `$WORK` before; I absolutely would _not_ write any substantial Rust project without it at this point.

# Inspirations

I wouldn't have gotten even this far on `scum`[^2] without the help of

- [`mal`](https://github.com/kanaka/mal),
- "Write you a Scheme," the [2.0 update](https://wespiser.com/writings/wyas/00_overview.html) and the [OG version](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours),
- SICP, both the [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) and the [video lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/),
- Peter Norvig's [beautifully](https://norvig.com/lispy.html) clean [Python](https://norvig.com/lispy2.html) implementations.

# Postscript

ðŸ‘‹ to the former coworker who enjoined me to blog more!
I miss working with you, friend.

[^2]: I didn't consume all of this recently in my quest to put `scum` together, but I would almost certainly be remiss in not mentioning these; in fact, I'm probably leaving lots out!
