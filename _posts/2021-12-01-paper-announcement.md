# New paper

I'm excited to announce that our paper on using quantum ML to predict
weather radar products is [up on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15605)!
What's more, per the [press
release](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/01/2344216/0/en/Rigetti-Enhances-Predictive-Weather-Modeling-with-Quantum-Machine-Learning.html),
we'll be presenting the paper at the [Artificial Intelligence for Humanitarian
Assistance and Disaster Response Workshop](https://www.hadr.ai/) at [NeurIPS
2021](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/Schedule?showEvent=21858).
