While working as an applied research mathematician in the Washington DC area, I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from [UNC Charlotte's Math Department](http://math.uncc.edu) in the Spring of 2013.
Then I worked as a Senior Data Scientist for a [Quantifind, Inc](https://www.quantifind.com).
Now I work as a Lead Research Scientist, Quantum Advantage for [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com).

On this blog I explore those topics I never had the time to when I was working on my dissertation; essentially anything mathematical, computational, statistical, etc. that I happen to find interesting.
For more about me, you can view my [CV]({{ "/public/cv/genos_cv.pdf" | absolute_url}}), my [GitHub](https://github.com/genos), my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/grenos), or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/graham_enos).

Obligatory notice: my views do not necessarily reflect those of anyone kind enough to employ me.
