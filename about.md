title: About

While working as an applied research mathematician in the Washington DC area, I
received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from [UNC Charlotte's Math
Department](http://math.uncc.edu) in the Spring of 2013.
I've since landed a gig as a Data Scientist for a [company out of
California](http://quantifind.com).
On this blog I explore those topics I never had the time to when I was working
on my dissertation; basically anything mathematical, computational, 
statistical, etc. that I happen to find interesting.
For more about me, you can view my CV ([bite-sized version here,]({{
site.baseurl }}public/cv/genos_cv.pdf) thorough and too long version [here]({{
site.baseurl }}public/cv/genos_cv_long.pdf)), my
[GitHub](https://github.com/genos), or my
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/graham_enos).

Obligatory notice: my views do not necessarily reflect those of anyone kind
enough to employ me.
