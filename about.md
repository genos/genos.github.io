While working as an Applied Research Mathematician for the US Department of Defense, I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from [UNC Charlotte's Math Department](http://math.uncc.edu) in the Spring of 2013.
After that, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist for a [Quantifind, Inc](https://www.quantifind.com).
Then I was a Lead Research Scientist, Quantum Advantage for [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com), before starting my current role as Vice President of Quantum Solutions at [Strangeworks](https://strangeworks.com/).

On this blog I explore those topics I never had the time to when I was working on my dissertation; essentially anything mathematical, computational, statistical, etc. that I happen to find interesting.
For more about me, you can view my [CV]({{ "/public/genos_cv.pdf" | absolute_url}}), my [GitHub](https://github.com/genos), my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/grenos), or my [Mathstodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@grahamenos).

Obligatory notice: my views do not necessarily reflect those of anyone kind enough to employ me.
